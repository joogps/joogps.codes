Hey there. Hope you're doing good. Welcome to my new website! I decided to build this place so that I could have somewhere to express myself and showcase my stuff, without any of the problems and challenges of social media and the world. Not only I now have a beautiful new homepage, I also have this blog to write not only about tech and software development, but also (and mostly, probably) about personal, regular life-related topics.
